# Number-Line
Simple Python Code

This is a simple programme created in Python to represent a number line running between 1 and 100
The programme asks for an input for a number between 1 and 100
if the input is valid it continues to say what numbers are smaller than the input and then the numbers which are bigger than it are printed as is
if the input is invalid it asks for an input again until a suitable input is provided
finally the programme asks the user if they want to try again, if the user says yes then they are prompted for input
if the user chooses not to continue then the programme ends.
